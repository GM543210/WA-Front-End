Aplication of an online Queueing theme made for purposes of easing access of queueing to Croatian 
citizens who must usually wait and stand in crowded lines of institutions, private businesses or 
organization buildings by allowing them to queue through an online app. Web-app would allow for
taking a place in the line using web instead of standing or waiting to be pushed around in not-so-favorable
conditions (especially for the elderly) or when simply in a hurry. Easy to use interface allows anyone to be an user and Queue Up!
